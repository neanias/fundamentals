# Fundamentals

This repo is an experiment in using template repos to create a suite of exercises to help junior
Ruby engineers get up to speed faster. The hope is that each directory will be a collection of
exercises around a specific topic, e.g. Ruby or RSpec. Each directory should have everything ready
to go for the player to get going, including a README with steps to complete; a Gemfile with
required gems and a collection of Ruby and spec files.
